Proposed Streamlit UI Design
1. Layout Design
Left Sidebar or Dropdown Menu: For selecting the primary command group (e.g., auth, cluster, config, etc.).
Main Area: Displays subcommands and their descriptions dynamically based on the selected group.
Inputs Section: Shows relevant input fields or options for the selected subcommand (e.g., fields for file upload, text input, toggles for enabling/disabling services, etc.).
Output Area: Displays the result of the selected operation.
2. Components for Each Section
Sidebar/Dropdown
A dropdown or sidebar list with all primary command groups.
Dynamic Subcommand Panel
A container with buttons/cards representing subcommands (e.g., add, remove, status).
Tooltip or modal to show subcommand descriptions.
Input Fields
Text input, checkboxes, file upload, or toggles based on the subcommand's requirements.
Action Button
A "Run Command" button to trigger the selected operation.
Output Display
A text box or table to show command results.
3. Styling and Enhancements
Collapsible Sections: For subcommands with multiple operations (e.g., config → cluster, nfs, smb).
Icons: Add icons to distinguish categories visually.
Dynamic Validation: Ensure valid inputs before executing commands.
Logging Panel: Include a section for command logs and errors.
4. Workflow
Select a primary command group.
Choose a subcommand.
Provide required inputs.
Click "Run Command" to execute.
View results or error messages in the output panel
