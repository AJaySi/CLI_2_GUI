Key Highlights
Command Input

Feature: A text input for CLI commands (st.text_input) allows users to type and submit commands.
User Story Addressed:
"As a user, I want to enter CLI commands into a text input so that I can interact with my system through the web UI."
Real-Time Output Display

Feature: Command output is streamed to the UI line-by-line using a callback function that updates an st.empty() placeholder.
User Story Addressed:
"As a user, I want the application to display command output in real time so that I can monitor the execution process without delay."
Visual Progress Indicator

Feature: A progress bar (st.progress) shows processing progress, providing visual feedback for the command execution.
User Story Addressed:
"As a user, I want to see a visual progress indicator while a command is running so that I know the system is processing my input."
Command History

Feature: A command history is maintained in st.session_state, displayed in the sidebar. This allows users to review and recall previous commands.
User Story Addressed:
"As a user, I want to view a history of my executed commands so that I can quickly recall and reuse previous inputs."
Error and Status Handling

Feature: The implementation captures stderr separately from stdout and displays it to the user, along with a final status message indicating the command completion and return code.
User Story Addressed:
"As a user, I want both standard output and error messages to be displayed so that I can easily identify and troubleshoot issues."
Non-Blocking Execution

Feature: The Thread module allows command execution to run in the background, keeping the UI responsive during long-running tasks.
User Story Addressed:
"As a developer, I want the CLI command execution to run in a background thread so that the UI remains responsive during long-running commands."
Additional Suggestions for Further Refinement
Command Validation

Validate the input command before execution to ensure it's not empty or invalid.
Interactive Commands

Enhance support for interactive commands using libraries like ptyprocess or pexpect.
Customizable Themes

Add styling options to make the terminal look more authentic with a CSS-like theme or a custom Streamlit component.
Save and Load Command History

Provide options to export the command history as a file or load previously saved histories.
Error Feedback

Highlight error messages with distinct styling (e.g., red font or a warning icon) to differentiate them from standard output.
Execution Time Tracking

Display the duration of each command execution to give users insights into performance.
